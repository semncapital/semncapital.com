						<h3 style="text-align:left;">Who We Are</h3><p style="text-align:left;">Southeast Minnesota Capital Fund (SMCF) is a member-driven angel investment group focused on backing Minnesota entrepreneurs and dedicated to fostering innovation and economic growth in Rochester and the Greater Southeast Minnesota region.</p><br>
                        <h3 style="text-align:left;">Our story</h3><p style="text-align:left;">SMCF traces its origins to a 2014 regional economic development plan sponsored by Rochester Area Economic Development Inc, (RAEDI) called “Journey to Growth” that recognized the need to create a local source of equity capital to support innovative businesses forming in Southeast Minnesota.<br><br>  
                        In 2017, RAEDI executives Gary Smith and Xavier Frigola formed SMCF and helped raise its initial $2 million fund (Fund I).  Between 2018 and 2021, SMCF invested Fund I in 14 Minnesota start-ups, ten of which are either located in SE MN or linked to  technologies developed at Mayo Clinic. <br><br> 
                        In 2022, SMCF launched fundraising for its second fund (Fund II) with a target size of $3-5 million.  RAEDI will act as Fund II’s primary sponsor and lead investor.<br><br>
                        Southeast Minnesota Capital Partners LLC (SMCP), a newly formed management company as described below, will provide fund management and administration services to both Fund I and Fund II beginning in January 2022.

                        <h3 style="text-align:left;">How We Operate</h3><p style="text-align:left;">SMCF is a member-driven organization that pools its capital and invests together.  It  holds periodic investment meetings, mostly in the early evening via Zoom, at which members hear presentations by the CEOs of companies under consideration for investment and then participate in group discussion.  SMCP, which manages the investment activities of the Fund, screens all potential companies before they are invited to pitch to SMCF members and then conducts follow up due diligence on those companies endorsed for possible investment.  SMCF’s  Executive Committee oversees Fund operations, sets the agendas for member meetings and coordinates votes by the SMCF Board of Managers. which must formally approve all investments.</p><br>
